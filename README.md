# Chronic_kidney_disease_predictor
Praposal [version-1]

January 27, 2023

Problem Statement

Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage our kidneys and decrease their ability to keep us healthy by filtering wastes from our blood. If kidney disease worsens, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick. We may develop complications like:

High Blood Pressure
Anaemia (Low Blood Count)
Weak Bones
Poor Nutritional Health
Nerve Damage

What is Chronic kidney disease

Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.
Structural or  functional abnormalities of the kidneys for more than three months, as manifested by either:
Kidney damage, with or without decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate, as defined by:
Pathologic Abnormalities
Markers of kidney damage including abnormalities in the composition of the blood or urine or abnormalities in imaging tests.

Aim 

Chronic Disease Prediction In Kidney: To predict chronic disease in kidney in more accurate and faster way to reduce attributes.

Specifications

We want to create a software with a hope to help solve the problem of chronic diseases taking over by affecting people and become significantly more lethal as time goes on. The symptoms of these diseases get overlooked most of the time as the symptoms aren’t that serious and people think of them as ordinary illnesses but in that stage are indeed curable and that too with ease.
We hope to design an AI/ML model that uses the combination of techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbour(kNN), Logistic Regression and Decision Tree to give the best advice to the user considering the current symptoms they are experiencing and the history of their illnesses throughout their life up until now. The model will be designed in Python with the main libraries being Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib. The whole AI/ML model and its services will be made accessible to the user using a web front that will be designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

TimeStamp:

January: Project Pitching and Proposal -Version (1) 

February: Research(R&D) on the topic and Documentation

March: Implementation of Code and Building User Interface

April : Testing , Deployment and Evaluation

Modules:

Pre-Processing & cleaning
Login page
User input and result page
Disease description page
Feature selection
Model building

Expected Outcome

The outcome we or better yet the users expect is the advice that the AI/ML model will provide the user to be able to cure the disease of the user or to at least help prolong the life of the user and prevent/ cure the chronic illnesses such as Kidney Failure, Dangerous levels of fluid in the system, Fluid Retention, Anaemia and Weak Bones. The users will have to input the symptoms they are currently experiencing and their medical history up until now in the model to get the best possible advice to accomplish the goal of curing the device which in turn will be the keystone to accomplish the final goal of the prolonging of human life.

         The project “Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction”.The main objective of the study is to analyze the status of Kidney in terms of health.Its a process of identifying the damage and harmful condition of the kidney and to advice the calm way to get rid of it and to establish a healthy relationship with our body.The Details regarding the illness of the kidney were collected through discussion with team members.

The various tools used for study are hospital medical history,patient symptoms,and the study on the causes and there frequency.Charts,table,graph are used for better understanding.Through deep analysis the people could understand the tenet,indication and remedy to the sickness and position of the kidney.

The project is following high estimation survey also followed by a deep research in the respective field
and tell how its affecting the Kidney in given period of time.On the other hand its revealing healthy way to keep it at good position for a persistence life,The Study recommends to reduce the unfit eating and to provide defense to Kidney and to increase the beneficial habits of consuming to discard this infection of the Kidney.
